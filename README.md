<p align="justify">Welcome to my developer page on GitHub! My name is <b>Lauro</b> and I currently live in this surreal country we call <b>Brazil</b>. I have a degree in Information Technology (Computer Science) and I work in the Business Intelligence segment as a <b>Full Stack Developer</b>. In my free time, I like to study Data Science and practice Machine Learning using Python. You can contact me on any of the social networks below:</p>

 <p align="justify">By the way, you will not see my full name, birth date, home address, family photos, or any other personal data on these social networks. This is not public information that can be collected and sold by those big tech companies. You also won't see me using Facebook, the most toxic of all social networks — nor would I ever install any social network app on my phone. If you use Facebook, or if you post your personal data on any social media, then consider watching this series produced by the newspaper "The New York Times": <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/23/opinion/data-privacy-jaron-lanier.html">JARON LANIER FIXES THE INTERNET</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">The world has become quite chaotic and complex in the last few decades, hyperconnected and fast-changing, yet with a total “bad vibe". After millennia of civilization we still have wars, massacres, genocides, heinous crimes, human rights violations, etc. In my opinion, we have forgotten the most important thing throughout history:&nbsp; WE ARE ALL HOMO SAPIENS, A SINGLE SPECIES OF A SINGLE PEOPLE.</p>

<p align="justify">Throughout this terrible pandemic, the immense number of deaths reminded us that human life is like a burning candle, just a blow to extinguish it. In view of this, I decided to put into practice an old dream of creating an <b>NGO</b> (Non-Governmental Organization) in the area of human rights. The name of the initiative is <b>United Sapiens</b> - the idea is to act globally. My main goal would be to support the <b>United Nations</b>' efforts to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts and political rivalries.</p>

```
     WE ARE SAPIENS
     ONE SPECIES OF ONE PEOPLE
     TOGETHER WE'LL BE STRONGER
     UNITED WE'LL BE INVINCIBLE

     NO ONE SHALL EVER DIVIDE US
     BY CASTE, RACE OR RELIGION
     OUR UNION WILL BECOME LEGION
     ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR ONE
```

<p align="justify">I created a <a href="https://github.com/United-Sapiens">GitHub Organization</a> to host the initiative's project. I'll try to contribute with what I know how to do, programming and making free / open source software available. You can also contribute, but only if you want to...</p>

# :sun_with_face:&nbsp; The Zodiac Program

<p align="justify">The Project Management Institute (<a href="https://www.pmi.org/">www.pmi.org</a>) defines a program as *"a group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually; programs may contain elements of work outside of the scope of the discrete projects in the program"*. The <b>Zodiac Program</b> is a series of projects that I started last March and that I intend to complete over the course of one year (2022 – 2023).</p>
