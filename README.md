<p align="justify">Welcome to my page on GitHub! My name is <b>Lauro</b> and I currently live in this surreal country we call <b>Brazil</b>. I have a degree in Information Technology (Full Stack Developer) and I work in the Business Intelligence segment as a <b>Machine Learning Engineer</b>. You can contact me on the social networks below, except Facebook of course. If you use facebook, the most toxic of social networks, then consider watching this series produced by the newspaper "The New York Times": <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/23/opinion/data-privacy-jaron-lanier.html" target="_blank">JARON LANIER FIXES THE INTERNET</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">Throughout this terrible pandemic, the immense number of deaths reminded us that human life is like a lit candle, just a blow to extinguish it. In view of this, I decided to put into practice an old dream of creating an <b>NGO</b> (Non-Governmental Organization) in the area of human rights. The name of the initiative is <b>United Sapiens</b> - the idea is to act globally.</p>

```
     WE ARE SAPIENS
     ONE SPECIES OF ONE PEOPLE
     TOGETHER WE'RE STRONGER
     UNITED WE'RE INVINCIBLE

     NO ONE SHALL EVER DIVIDE US
     BY CASTE, RACE OR RELIGION
     FOR WE ARE LEGION
     ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR ONE
```

<p align="justify">I created a <a href="https://github.com/United-Sapiens" target="_blank">GitHub Organization</a> to host the initiative's work. I'll try to contribute with what I know how to do, programming and making free / open source software available. You can also contribute, but only if you want to...</p>
